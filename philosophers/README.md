Philosophers

Overview

The Philosophers project is a concurrency exercise that explores the basics of threading and mutexes in C. Inspired by the classic dining philosophers problem, this project involves creating a simulation where philosophers alternately eat, think, and sleep without dying of starvation.

Goals

The objectives of the Philosophers project are to:

- Understand and implement threading in C.
- Learn to use mutexes to manage concurrent access to shared resources.
- Develop a simulation that adheres to specific rules and constraints.
- Ensure proper memory management and prevent data races.

Features

- Simulation of philosophers' behavior with threading.
- Use of mutexes to protect shared resources (forks).
- Logging of philosophers' state changes.
- Proper handling of simulation parameters.
