Overview
Cube3D is a project inspired by the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game, the first FPS ever created. This project, part of the 42 coding school curriculum, challenges you to create a dynamic 3D maze exploration game using ray-casting techniques.

Goals
The objectives of the Cube3D project are to:

Enhance your programming skills in C.
Implement basic algorithms and data structures.
Apply mathematical concepts to create efficient algorithms.
Develop a graphical application using miniLibX.
Features
First-person view inside a maze using ray-casting.
Display different wall textures depending on their orientation.
Smooth window management.
Color customization for the floor and ceiling.
Responsive controls for navigation and interaction.
