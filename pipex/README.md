Overview

Pipex is a project that explores the detailed workings of UNIX pipes by implementing them in a C program. This project is part of the 42 coding school curriculum and aims to deepen your understanding of process communication in UNIX systems.

Goals

The objectives of the Pipex project are to:

- Understand and implement UNIX pipes in C.
- Learn to handle process creation and management using system calls.
- Develop a program that mimics the behavior of shell pipelines.
- Ensure proper error handling and memory management.

Features

- Execution of shell commands connected by pipes.
- Handling of input and output redirection.
- Thorough error handling.
- Prevention of memory leaks.
