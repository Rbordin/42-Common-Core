Push_swap

Overview

Push_swap is a project that challenges you to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and the lowest possible number of actions. This project is part of the 42 coding school curriculum and aims to enhance your understanding of sorting algorithms and their complexities.

Goals

The objectives of the Push_swap project are to:

- Understand and implement sorting algorithms in C.
- Learn to manage stack data structures and their operations.
- Develop an optimized sorting solution with minimal operations.
- Ensure proper error handling and memory management.

Features

- Sorting integers on a stack using a specific set of operations.
- Generating the smallest possible list of instructions to achieve the sorted order.
- Handling various edge cases and input errors.
