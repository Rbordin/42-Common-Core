CPP Modules

Overview
  This project contains a series of modules designed to help you understand the specificities of C++ compared to C. The modules cover various topics from basic C++ syntax to advanced concepts like templates and polymorphism. The goal is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and other essential features of C++.

Goals

The objectives of the CPP Modules are to:

- Learn and understand the basic and advanced features of C++.
- Develop a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through various exercises and projects.
- Gain practical experience with C++ standard libraries and best practices.

Modules

  - Module 00: Introduction to C++
    - Topics Covered: Basics of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static and const.
    - Objectives: Familiarize yourself with the fundamental concepts and syntax of C++.
  - Module 01: Memory Allocation and Pointers
    - Topics Covered: Memory allocation, references, pointers to members, switch statements.
    - Objectives: Understand memory management in C++ and how to use pointers and references effectively.
  - Module 02: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism and Overloading
    - Topics Covered: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical class form.
    - Objectives: Learn how to implement polymorphism and overload operators in C++.
  - Module 03: Inheritance
    - Topics Covered: Class inheritance.
    - Objectives: Understand how inheritance works in C++ and how to design class hierarchies.
  - Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism and Abstract Classes
    - Topics Covered: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.
    - Objectives: Learn about abstract classes and interfaces to implement polymorphic behavior.
  - Module 05: Exceptions
    - Topics Covered: Try/catch blocks, exceptions.
    - Objectives: Handle exceptions and errors gracefully in your C++ programs.
  - Module 06: Casting
    - Topics Covered: Different types of casts (static_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast).
    - Objectives: Understand the various casting operators in C++ and when to use them.
  - Module 07: Templates
    - Topics Covered: Templates.
    - Objectives: Learn how to create and use templates for generic programming.
  - Module 08: Templated Containers and Algorithms
    - Topics Covered: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms.
    - Objectives: Understand the use of templates in the Standard Template Library (STL) and how to implement your own templated containers and algorithms.
